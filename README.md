# namepicker
Picks a __true__ random name out of the set of names selected by the user (using www.random.org API). Repo for http://www.cspotrun.org/namepicker

### Build
This site is built using HAML, so changes made to ./index.haml need to be compiled into ./index.html.

#### Licensing:

My intention is whatever the current version of the MIT license is. I'll get around to it later.
